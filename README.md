Table Filter proof of concept
--

During the design of an application we needed to decide how to implement filters on tables.

I had several ideas and wrote this proof of concept to make it easier to explain and try out the different approaches.
The original version was using SolidJS - this is a
conversion of that into React. The application was installed on Cloudflare Pages so everybody could access it easily
during meetings and the design phase.
